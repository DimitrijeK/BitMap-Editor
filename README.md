## Java Application 

This project was developed by me. And it is a Java Application that allows user to create Images while manipulating pixels.

The application prompts user for the dimensions of your Image on startup. Displays a button for each pixel and user can choose different colors for each pixel by using sliders on the side to select a color. Once a button is clicked the Pixel associated with that button gets its color set to the color you choosed and the color of the button will change. User can also save this Icon as an image to any directory on their machine. If you have any questions/suggestions/concerns, please feel free to contact me dkastratovic@carthage.edu :thumbsup:
